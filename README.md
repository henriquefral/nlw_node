About
=========
   This project aims to create a mini social network that allows users to send compliments to each other. 

   Where new compliments can be created, only by admins.

   For example: User X indicates a compliment to User Y. User Y now has the compliment sent in their profile.



Details
==========
This app is built with TypeScript. Converted to JavaScript with ``` ts-node-dev ``` dependency.

To creating the application, I used these technologies:

- Express;
- MySql;
- TypeOrm;
- Reflect-Metadata
- JWT
- BcryptJs.
